Trampolino - the automatic, arduino-powered water pourer
--------------------------------------------------------

Trampolino is an open source arduino based project.

I use to build and upload this project to my Arduino UNO R3 on a Linux machine via [ino](https://github.com/amperka/ino).

After installing ino, you need to change to the project directory:

- cd /path/to/arduino-trampolino

build the project

- ino build


connect the arduino and upload

- ino upload


Please visit the project page for more information:
